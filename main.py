    main(): Entry point, handles a menu system and game initialization

Dependencies:
    - sys: For program exit
    - view.game_gui: For user interface elements
    - controller.question_generator: For article pair generation

    To run the game (depending on your environment):
        $ python main.py
    or:
        $ python3 main.py
